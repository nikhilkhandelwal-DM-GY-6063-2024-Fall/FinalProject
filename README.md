# **Final Project: Mini Arcade Game**

## **Overview**
This project is a simple arcade-style game where players control an object (e.g., a spaceship or a character) using buttons connected to an Arduino. The game environment is displayed using p5.js and includes dynamic visuals, sound effects, and a scoring system. The objective is to navigate obstacles and collect items to achieve a high score. 

The project showcases a combination of physical computing and creative coding, integrating concepts learned throughout the course.

**Algorithms:**

**Button Input Handling (Arduino):**

Debounce algorithm to avoid multiple detections for a single button press:

bool isButtonPressed(int pin) {
    static unsigned long lastPressTime = 0;
    const unsigned long debounceDelay = 50; // milliseconds
    if (digitalRead(pin) == HIGH) {
        if (millis() - lastPressTime > debounceDelay) {
            lastPressTime = millis();
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

**Collision Detection:**

Check if the player's position overlaps with obstacles:

function checkCollisions() {
    if (player.x < obstacle.x + obstacle.width &&
        player.x + player.width > obstacle.x &&
        player.y < obstacle.y + obstacle.height &&
        player.height + player.y > obstacle.y) {
        endGame(); // Collision detected
    }
}
