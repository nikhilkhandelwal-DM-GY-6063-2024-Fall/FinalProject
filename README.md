**Algorithms:**

**Button Input Handling (Arduino):**

Debounce algorithm to avoid multiple detections for a single button press:

bool isButtonPressed(int pin) {
    static unsigned long lastPressTime = 0;
    const unsigned long debounceDelay = 50; // milliseconds
    if (digitalRead(pin) == HIGH) {
        if (millis() - lastPressTime > debounceDelay) {
            lastPressTime = millis();
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

**Collision Detection:**

Check if the player's position overlaps with obstacles:

function checkCollisions() {
    if (player.x < obstacle.x + obstacle.width &&
        player.x + player.width > obstacle.x &&
        player.y < obstacle.y + obstacle.height &&
        player.height + player.y > obstacle.y) {
        endGame(); // Collision detected
    }
}


# **Mini Arcade Game - Milestone 3**

## **Overview**
The Mini Arcade Game is a keyboard-controlled game where the player avoids falling obstacles by moving left or right. This milestone demonstrates the core progress of the project, including responsive visuals, score tracking, increasing difficulty, and game logic.  

---

## **Features Implemented**
1. **Player Movement**:  
   - Controlled using the **LEFT** and **RIGHT** arrow keys.  
2. **Random Falling Objects**:  
   - Shapes include **squares, ellipses, and triangles**.  
   - Objects fall at increasing speed as the game progresses.  
3. **Score and High Score**:  
   - Displays the player's **current score** and retains the **highest score**.  
4. **Game Over Condition**:  
   - Game ends when the player collides with a falling object.  
5. **Game Restart**:  
   - Press **'R'** to restart after a game over.  
6. **Responsive Canvas**:  
   - The game dynamically resizes to fit the browser window.

---


1. **Start**: The game begins and waits for player input.  
2. **Gameplay**: Objects fall, and the player moves to avoid them.  
3. **Collision Detected**: If a falling object collides with the player, the game ends.  
4. **Game Over**: Displays the player's score and allows restart with 'R'.  
5. **Restart**: Resets the game variables and restarts the game loop.

---

## **Circuit Diagram**
*No Arduino integration in this milestone*.  
The game is currently controlled via **keyboard input** for demonstration purposes.

---

## **Code Structure**
1. **Player Movement**:  
   - Controlled with **LEFT** and **RIGHT** arrow keys.  

2. **Falling Objects**:  
   - Shapes are randomly generated with varying positions, sizes, and types (squares, ellipses, triangles).  

3. **Collision Detection**:  
   - Checks if any falling object intersects with the player.

4. **Score and High Score**:  
   - Score increases by **10 points** for every object avoided.  
   - The high score is retained across game resets.

5. **Increasing Difficulty**:  
   - Objects fall faster as the game progresses, increasing difficulty.

6. **Game Restart**:  
   - Press 'R' to reset the game state.

---

## **Pseudocode for Remaining Features**
1. **Integration with Arduino**:  
   - Replace keyboard inputs with button signals from the Arduino:  
     ```
     If LEFT_BUTTON_PRESSED:
         Move player left
     If RIGHT_BUTTON_PRESSED:
         Move player right
     ```

2. **Audio Integration**:  
   - Play sound effects for collisions and game over:  
     ```
     If collision detected:
         Play "collision.wav"
         Play "gameover.wav"
     ```

3. **Visual Enhancements**:  
   - Add background animations and falling object variations.

---

## **How to Run**
1. Copy the p5.js code into the **p5.js Web Editor** or run it locally using a web server.  
2. Use the **LEFT ARROW** and **RIGHT ARROW** keys to control the player.  
3. Avoid the falling shapes to increase your score.  
4. Press **'R'** to restart the game if you lose.

---

## **Plan for Next Steps**
1. Integrate physical inputs using Arduino buttons.  
2. Add audio effects for collisions and game over.  
3. Polish visuals (background, animations).  
4. Finalize testing and debugging.
