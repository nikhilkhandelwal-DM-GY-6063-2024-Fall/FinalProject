# **Final Project: Mini Arcade Game**

## **Overview**
This project is a simple arcade-style game where players control an object (e.g., a spaceship or a character) using buttons connected to an Arduino. The game environment is displayed using p5.js and includes dynamic visuals, sound effects, and a scoring system. The objective is to navigate obstacles and collect items to achieve a high score. 

The project showcases a combination of physical computing and creative coding, integrating concepts learned throughout the course.
